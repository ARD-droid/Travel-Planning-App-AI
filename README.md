🌟 Introducing My Latest AI Project! 🌟
I've been building an AI-driven Travel Planning App using Python, Streamlit, LangChain, and Google GenAI! 🚆✈️🚖
This app simplifies trip planning by helping users find the best travel options (flights, buses, trains, and cabs) along with estimated costs—saving time and effort!

Tech Highlights:
🔹 Python for backend logic
🔹 Streamlit for an intuitive UI
🔹 LangChain for AI-powered interactions
🔹 Google GenAI for smart travel insights
